.SH DESCRIPTION

.B simple_shell
The simple_shell utility is a command language interpreter that shall execute commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a specified file. 

.SH OPERANDS

.TP
The following operands shall be supported:

-                A single <hyphen-minus> shall be treated as the first
                 operand and then ignored. If both '-' and "--" are
                 given as arguments, or if other operands precede the
                 single <hyphen-minus>, the results are undefined.

.TP

- argument: The positional parameters shall be set to arguments.

.TP

- command_file:  The pathname of a file containing commands. If the
                 pathname contains one or more <slash> characters, the
                 implementation attempts to read that file; the file
                 need not be executable. If the pathname does not
                 contain a <slash> character:

		 *   The implementation shall attempt to read that file
                     from the current working directory; the file need
                     not be executable.

		 *   If the file is not in the current working
                     directory, the implementation may perform a search
                     for an executable file using the value of PATH.
