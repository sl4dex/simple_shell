## What’s is a shell program and why you would use it?

In computing, a shell is a computer program that exposes an operating  
system’s services to a human user or other programs. In general, operating  
system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user  
interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation.  
It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating   
system.

In this case, our shell is only used through the Command-line interface (CLI),  
because this is the most popular use for computing science’s operations.

Command-line shells require the user to be familiar with commands and  
their calling syntax and to understand concepts about the shell-specific  
scripting language (for example, bash).

Operating systems provide various services to their users, including file  
management, process management (running and terminating applications),  
batch processing, and operating system monitoring and configuration.

All these services are possible because the shells count with command lines  
which you gonna use to manipulate and manage different  computer's com-  
ponents, as can be the Random Access Memory (RAM), the Hard Disk, etc. All  
this is through your system operator as we said previously.

### Command-line interface

A command-line interface (CLI) is an operating system shell that uses  alpha-  
numeric characters typed on a keyboard to provide instructions and data  
to the operating system, interactively.
Operating systems such as UNIX have  
a large variety of shell programs with different commands, syntax, and cap-  
abilities, with the POSIX shell being a baseline.
